The data is captured from 2018-01-01 12:25:31 to 2018-08-30 19:13:12
Number of unique IP addresses: 		     367,108
#IP address using at least once > sslv3	     364,001
The total data set consists of records: 	28,357,106				
Number of IPs with multiple entries:		
records where handshake == sslv3		     392,924
servers using SSLv3 in the first record 	         3,062 
servers using SSLv3 in the last record 	         3,054 
IP entries that use both sslv3 and a newer one    8,363


How many hosts remain vulnerable up to the end of the data set
How many hosts migrate to the new SSL handshake versions on a daily basis
Potentially aggregate hosts by region/country for analysis
Outliers (People who go from newer encryption to older ones)
